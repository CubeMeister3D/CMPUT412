Repository for solution code for CMPUT 412 - Experimental Mobile Robotics (W25)

Programs/projects for each exercise will be organized according to their exercise name (i.e: Exercise_1)

Solution code is located in the /packages directory, organized into subfolders for each program.

Python files will start with the prefix "exX, where X is the name of the exercise (1, 2, etc...)


Exercise 3-
All of the code for exercise 3 can be foun in cmput-412/Exercise_2/Ex2_implementation/packages/ex3/src
The three python scripts that were used in this exercise were lane_detection_p2.py and camera_distortion.py

camera_distortion.py can be launched using  -dts devel run -L camera_distortion
	- camera distortion is used for part one
lane_detection_p2.py can be launched using  -dts devel run -L lan_detection_p2
	-lane_detection_p2 is used for both parts 2 and 3

Exercise4-
All of the code for exercise 4 can be found in cmput-412/exercise4/packages/ex4/src
